# 👋 Hey, I'm Dhruv

I'm a solo developer who builds tools, explores systems, and documents the process along the way.

### 🛠 Projects I’ve Built

- 🚦 [**Throttl**](https://github.com/dhruv-chaudhary/throttl) — A blazing-fast token bucket rate limiter with wrk benchmarks build using Bun 
- 🧠 [**buildbreakrepeat.dev**](https://buildbreakrepeat.dev) — My blog where I document software, hardware, homelab, and random experiments

> I’ve built 100+ projects, but most of them are locked away in the shame drawer.  
> Only the most photogenic, borderline-portfolio-worthy ones make it here.  
> The rest? We don’t talk about them. They served their purpose… mostly as emotional support builds.


### 🧠 Tech Stack (a.k.a. Why I Can Never Pick One Thing)

I may or may not have commitment issues — so I learned:

**Frontend**  
- JavaScript, TypeScript (of course)  
- Vue & Nuxt (for the elegance)  
- React & Next.js (because job listings demand it)  
- Tailwind & Bootstrap (utility-first vs utility-never-ending)

**Backend**  
- Node.js, Bun (hello speed)  
- Java + Spring Boot (because enterprise™)  
- Python + Flask (for when I want to feel productive *and* chaotic)

**Bonus:**  
- Can probably write a REST API in my sleep.  
- Might accidentally start a CLI tool while trying to fix a bash script.
